Project on PCA/LDA Algorithms

# **Regression Analysis Project**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on implementing regression models to predict numerical outputs based on given input features. The project includes:
1. **Linear Regression:** Simple and multiple regression models.
2. **Polynomial Regression:** Captures non-linear relationships.
3. **Regularized Regression:** Lasso and Ridge regression for preventing overfitting.

The objective is to evaluate the models' performance using regression metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, **R-squared**, and **visualizations** of the predicted vs. actual values.

## **Dataset**
The dataset contains multiple features (independent variables) and one numerical target variable (dependent variable). The goal is to train regression models and predict the target value.

## **Key Methodologies**

### **1. Linear Regression**
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Handled missing values by imputing or removing incomplete data.
  - Split the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets.
- **Linear Model:**
  - Fitted a simple or multiple linear regression model to learn the relationship between features and the target variable.
- **Results:**
  - Visualized the regression line and checked residual errors.

### **2. Polynomial Regression**
- Applied polynomial transformations to capture non-linear patterns in the data.
- Compared the performance of polynomial models of different degrees.

### **3. Regularized Regression (Lasso and Ridge)**
- Implemented **Lasso** (L1 regularization) and **Ridge** (L2 regularization) to prevent overfitting in complex datasets.
- Tuned hyperparameters (alpha) to find the best-performing model.
